                <img src="https://www.holidify.com/images/cmsuploads/compressed/indian-1768906_1920_20180322173733.jpg" alt = "dosa" />
                <p>Dosa is one of the most common breakfast items in Tamil Nadu. Served with sambhar and coconut chutney, it is a very filling and healthy dish. Dosa is made of rice flour, gram, and curry leaves. The dosa we get in Tamil Nadu is different from other regions on some ingredients used. It is the traditional dish of this state and is a must-try one as well. It is also called Dosai by some people.</p>

                <h3>chicken65</h3>
                <img src="https://cdn.tasteatlas.com/Images/Dishes/c6a3e39b2b6a41bdb9cc5ca04a98a43e.jpg?mw=1300" alt = "chicken 65"/>
                <p>Chicken 65 is a classic poultry dish with origins in Chennai, India. It consists of deep-fried chicken that is marinated in ginger, lemon, red chiles, and a variety of other spices. There are a few theories about the origin of chicken 65. The most popular theory says that it was created in Tamil Nadu by A. M. Buhari in 1965.

                Another one says that the original dish was made with 65 hot chili peppers, as a testament of manliness. There are also some unlikely theories, such as the one claiming that the chicken was cut into 65 pieces, or that the chicken was 65 days old when the dish was prepared.

                Due to the dish's popularity, there are numerous variations, and each South Indian state has its own version. In Karnataka, the dish is garnished with grated coconut, and in Andhra Pradesh, the chicken is cooked instead of fried. Chicken 65 is commonly served with hot, red chutneys.

                <p>Murukku is a popular Indian snack with a crunchy texture, usually made with rice flour and urad dal bean flour, combined together into a spiral-shaped paste that is deep-fried in oil. Most of these savory snacks are additionally flavored with cumin, onion powder, or chili.

                Originating from Tamil Nadu, its name means twisted, referring to its unusual shape. Today, it is widely available throughout India, but it is most popular in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, and of course, Tamil Nadu. Murukku is often prepared for Indian festivities such as Diwali, Krishna Jayanti, and Vinayaka Chaturthi.

                Due to its great popularity, there are different versions of the snack, so it is sometimes dusted with sesame seeds and salt, while minced vegetables are often added to the paste before cooking.</p>

                <p>Popularly known as curd rice, this is the most common and easiest type of rice to make. This dish is made of rice, curd, and cream and tempered with mustard seeds, daal and other ingredients. Lunch in Tamil Nadu is incomplete without having curd rice. It is an easy to digest dish but a nutritious one too</p>
